# OpenWoZ
---
## Discription
The project involves developing a community-standard open-source framework for a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) system. WoZ is a common technique enabling Human-Robot Interaction researchers to explore aspects of interaction not yet backed by autonomous systems.

The system will include a web application running on an embedded platform which controls a robotics system. It also includes a platform-agnostic client framework that gets updated from a user-accessible database. The system needs to be generic enough to ensure that new robot behavior can be added easily and during run-time.
